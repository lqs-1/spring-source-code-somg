== Spring MVC Test Integration

Spring Security provides comprehensive integration with https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/testing.html#spring-mvc-test-framework[Spring MVC Test]

[[test-mockmvc-setup]]
=== Setting Up MockMvc and Spring Security

In order to use Spring Security with Spring MVC Test it is necessary to add the Spring Security `FilterChainProxy` as a `Filter`.
It is also necessary to add Spring Security's `TestSecurityContextHolderPostProcessor` to support <<Running as a User in Spring MVC Test with Annotations,Running as a User in Spring MVC Test with Annotations>>.
This can be done using Spring Security's `SecurityMockMvcConfigurers.springSecurity()`.
For example:

NOTE: Spring Security's testing support requires spring-test-4.1.3.RELEASE or greater.

[source,java]
----

import static org.springframework.security.test.web.servlet.setup.SecurityMockMvcConfigurers.*;

@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
@ContextConfiguration(classes = SecurityConfig.class)
@WebAppConfiguration
public class CsrfShowcaseTests {

	@Autowired
	private WebApplicationContext context;

	private MockMvc mvc;

	@Before
	public void setup() {
		mvc = MockMvcBuilders
				.webAppContextSetup(context)
				.apply(springSecurity()) // <1>
				.build();
	}

...
----

<1> `SecurityMockMvcConfigurers.springSecurity()` will perform all of the initial setup we need to integrate Spring Security with Spring MVC Test

[[test-mockmvc-smmrpp]]
=== SecurityMockMvcRequestPostProcessors

Spring MVC Test provides a convenient interface called a `RequestPostProcessor` that can be used to modify a request.
Spring Security provides a number of `RequestPostProcessor` implementations that make testing easier.
In order to use Spring Security's `RequestPostProcessor` implementations ensure the following static import is used:

[source,java]
----
import static org.springframework.security.test.web.servlet.request.SecurityMockMvcRequestPostProcessors.*;
----

[[test-mockmvc-csrf]]
==== Testing with CSRF Protection

When testing any non-safe HTTP methods and using Spring Security's CSRF protection, you must be sure to include a valid CSRF Token in the request.
To specify a valid CSRF token as a request parameter using the following:

[source,java]
----
mvc
	.perform(post("/").with(csrf()))
----

If you like you can include CSRF token in the header instead:

[source,java]
----
mvc
	.perform(post("/").with(csrf().asHeader()))
----

You can also test providing an invalid CSRF token using the following:

[source,java]
----
mvc
	.perform(post("/").with(csrf().useInvalidToken()))
----

[[test-mockmvc-securitycontextholder]]
==== Running a Test as a User in Spring MVC Test

It is often desirable to run tests as a specific user.
There are two simple ways of populating the user:

* <<Running as a User in Spring MVC Test with RequestPostProcessor,Running as a User in Spring MVC Test with RequestPostProcessor>>
* <<Running as a User in Spring MVC Test with Annotations,Running as a User in Spring MVC Test with Annotations>>

[[test-mockmvc-securitycontextholder-rpp]]
==== Running as a User in Spring MVC Test with RequestPostProcessor

There are a number of options available to associate a user to the current `HttpServletRequest`.
For example, the following will run as a user (which does not need to exist) with the username "user", the password "password", and the role "ROLE_USER":

[NOTE]
====
The support works by associating the user to the `HttpServletRequest`.
To associate the request to the `SecurityContextHolder` you need to ensure that the `SecurityContextPersistenceFilter` is associated with the `MockMvc` instance.
A few ways to do this are:

* Invoking <<test-mockmvc-setup,apply(springSecurity())>>
* Adding Spring Security's `FilterChainProxy` to `MockMvc`
* Manually adding `SecurityContextPersistenceFilter` to the `MockMvc` instance may make sense when using `MockMvcBuilders.standaloneSetup`
====

[source,java]
----
mvc
	.perform(get("/").with(user("user")))
----

You can easily make customizations.
For example, the following will run as a user (which does not need to exist) with the username "admin", the password "pass", and the roles "ROLE_USER" and "ROLE_ADMIN".

[source,java]
----
mvc
	.perform(get("/admin").with(user("admin").password("pass").roles("USER","ADMIN")))
----

If you have a custom `UserDetails` that you would like to use, you can easily specify that as well.
For example, the following will use the specified `UserDetails` (which does not need to exist) to run with a `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` that has a principal of the specified `UserDetails`:

[source,java]
----
mvc
	.perform(get("/").with(user(userDetails)))
----

You can run as anonymous user using the following:

[source,java]
----
mvc
	.perform(get("/").with(anonymous()))
----

This is especially useful if you are running with a default user and wish to execute a few requests as an anonymous user.

If you want a custom `Authentication` (which does not need to exist) you can do so using the following:

[source,java]
----
mvc
	.perform(get("/").with(authentication(authentication)))
----

You can even customize the `SecurityContext` using the following:

[source,java]
----
mvc
	.perform(get("/").with(securityContext(securityContext)))
----

We can also ensure to run as a specific user for every request by using ``MockMvcBuilders``'s default request.
For example, the following will run as a user (which does not need to exist) with the username "admin", the password "password", and the role "ROLE_ADMIN":

[source,java]
----
mvc = MockMvcBuilders
		.webAppContextSetup(context)
		.defaultRequest(get("/").with(user("user").roles("ADMIN")))
		.apply(springSecurity())
		.build();
----

If you find you are using the same user in many of your tests, it is recommended to move the user to a method.
For example, you can specify the following in your own class named `CustomSecurityMockMvcRequestPostProcessors`:

[source,java]
----
public static RequestPostProcessor rob() {
	return user("rob").roles("ADMIN");
}
----

Now you can perform a static import on `SecurityMockMvcRequestPostProcessors` and use that within your tests:

[source,java]
----
import static sample.CustomSecurityMockMvcRequestPostProcessors.*;

...

mvc
	.perform(get("/").with(rob()))
----

===== Running as a User in Spring MVC Test with Annotations

As an alternative to using a `RequestPostProcessor` to create your user, you can use annotations described in <<Testing Method Security>>.
For example, the following will run the test with the user with username "user", password "password", and role "ROLE_USER":

[source,java]
----
@Test
@WithMockUser
public void requestProtectedUrlWithUser() throws Exception {
mvc
		.perform(get("/"))
		...
}
----

Alternatively, the following will run the test with the user with username "user", password "password", and role "ROLE_ADMIN":

[source,java]
----
@Test
@WithMockUser(roles="ADMIN")
public void requestProtectedUrlWithUser() throws Exception {
mvc
		.perform(get("/"))
		...
}
----

==== Testing HTTP Basic Authentication

While it has always been possible to authenticate with HTTP Basic, it was a bit tedious to remember the header name, format, and encode the values.
Now this can be done using Spring Security's `httpBasic` `RequestPostProcessor`.
For example, the snippet below:

[source,java]
----
mvc
	.perform(get("/").with(httpBasic("user","password")))
----

will attempt to use HTTP Basic to authenticate a user with the username "user" and the password "password" by ensuring the following header is populated on the HTTP Request:

[source,text]
----
Authorization: Basic dXNlcjpwYXNzd29yZA==
----

=== SecurityMockMvcRequestBuilders

Spring MVC Test also provides a `RequestBuilder` interface that can be used to create the `MockHttpServletRequest` used in your test.
Spring Security provides a few `RequestBuilder` implementations that can be used to make testing easier.
In order to use Spring Security's `RequestBuilder` implementations ensure the following static import is used:

[source,java]
----
import static org.springframework.security.test.web.servlet.request.SecurityMockMvcRequestBuilders.*;
----

==== Testing Form Based Authentication

You can easily create a request to test a form based authentication using Spring Security's testing support.
For example, the following will submit a POST to "/login" with the username "user", the password "password", and a valid CSRF token:

[source,java]
----
mvc
	.perform(formLogin())
----

It is easy to customize the request.
For example, the following will submit a POST to "/auth" with the username "admin", the password "pass", and a valid CSRF token:

[source,java]
----
mvc
	.perform(formLogin("/auth").user("admin").password("pass"))
----

We can also customize the parameters names that the username and password are included on.
For example, this is the above request modified to include the username on the HTTP parameter "u" and the password on the HTTP parameter "p".

[source,java]
----
mvc
	.perform(formLogin("/auth").user("u","admin").password("p","pass"))
----

[[testing-oidc-login]]
==== Testing OIDC Login

In order to make an authenticated request on an OAuth 2.0 client, you would need to simulate some kind of grant flow with an authorization server.
However, Spring Security's OAuth 2.0 Client test support can help remove much of this boilerplate.

If your client uses OIDC to authenticate, then you can use the `oidcLogin()` `RequestPostProcessor` to configure a `MockMvc` request with an authenticated user.
The simplest of these would look something like this:

[source,java]
----
mvc.perform(get("/endpoint").with(oidcLogin()));
----

What this will do is create a mock `OidcUser`, passing it correctly through any authentication APIs so that it's available for your controllers and so on.
It contains a mock `OidcUserInfo`, a mock `OidcIdToken`, and a mock `Collection` of granted authorities.
Also, <<testing-oauth2-client,a mock `OAuth2AuthorizedClient`>> associated with the user is registered to an `HttpSessionOAuth2AuthorizedClientRepository`.

By default, the user info has no claims, and the id token has the `sub` claim, like so:

[source,json]
----
{
    "sub" : "user"
}
----

And the resulting `OidcUser`, were it tested, would pass in the following way:

[source,java]
----
assertThat(user.getIdToken().getTokenValue()).isEqualTo("id-token");
assertThat(user.getIdToken().getClaim("sub")).isEqualTo("user");
assertThat(user.getUserInfo().getClaims()).isEmpty();
GrantedAuthority authority = user.getAuthorities().iterator().next();
assertThat(authority.getAuthority()).isEqualTo("SCOPE_read");
----

These values can, of course be configured.

Any claims can be configured with their corresponding methods:

[source,java]
----
mvc.perform(get("/endpoint")
        .with(oidcLogin()
                .idToken(idToken -> idToken.subject("my-subject"))
                .userInfo(info -> info.firstName("Rob"))));
----

[source,java]
----
mvc.perform(get("/endpoint")
        .with(oidcLogin().idToken(idToken -> idToken.claims(claims -> claims.remove("scope")))));
----

By default, `oidcLogin()` adds a `SCOPE_read` `GrantedAuthority`.
However, this can be overridden simply by providing the list of `GrantedAuthority` instances that you need for your test:

[source,java]
----
mvc
    .perform(get("/endpoint")
        .with(oidcLogin().authorities(new SimpleGrantedAuthority("SCOPE_messages"))));
----

Or, you can supply all detail via an instance of `OidcUser` like so:

[source,java]
----
mvc.perform(get("/endpoint")
        .with(oidcLogin().oidcUser(new MyOidcUser())));
----

[[testing-oauth2-login]]
==== Testing OAuth 2.0 Login

Or, if your client uses OAuth 2.0 to authenticate, but not OIDC, then you can use the `oauth2Login()` `RequestPostProcessor` to configure a `MockMvc` request with an authenticated user.
The simplest of these would look something like this:

[source,java]
----
mvc.perform(get("/endpoint").with(oauth2Login()));
----

What this will do is create a mock `OAuth2User`, passing it correctly through any authentication APIs so that it's available for your controllers and so on.
It contains a mock set of attributes and a mock `Collection` of granted authorities.
Also, <<testing-oauth2-client,a mock `OAuth2AuthorizedClient`>> associated with the user is registered to an `HttpSessionOAuth2AuthorizedClientRepository`.

By default, the set of attributes contains only `sub`:

[source,json]
----
{
  "sub" : "user"
}
----

And the resulting `OAuth2User`, were it tested, would pass in the following way:

[source,java]
----
assertThat(user.getClaim("sub")).isEqualTo("user");
GrantedAuthority authority = user.getAuthorities().iterator().next();
assertThat(authority.getAuthority()).isEqualTo("SCOPE_read");
----

These values can, of course be configured.

Any claims can be configured via the underlying `Map`:

[source,java]
----
mvc.perform(get("/endpoint")
        .with(oauth2Login()
                .attributes(attrs -> attrs.put("sub", "my-subject"))));
----

[source,java]
----
mvc.perform(get("/endpoint")
        .with(oauth2Login()
                .attributes(attrs -> attrs.remove("some_claim"))));
----

By default, `oauth2User()` adds a `SCOPE_read` `GrantedAuthority`.
However, this can be overridden simply by providing the list of `GrantedAuthority` instances that you need for your test:

[source,java]
----
mvc
    .perform(get("/endpoint")
        .with(oauth2Login().authorities(new SimpleGrantedAuthority("SCOPE_messages"))));
----

Or, you can supply all detail via an instance of `OAuth2User` like so:

[source,java]
----
mvc.perform(get("/endpoint")
        .with(oauth2Login().oauth2User(new MyOAuth2User())));
----

[[testing-oauth2-client]]
==== Testing OAuth 2.0 Clients

Independent of how your user authenticates, there may be other OAuth 2.0 tokens that the request will need in order to communicate with resource servers, say in an integration test.

If you need to express an OAuth 2.0 client in your test, then you can use the `oauth2Client()` `RequestPostProcessor` to configure a `MockMvc` request with an authorized client.
The simplest of these would look something like this:

[source,java]
----
mvc.perform(get("/endpoint").with(oauth2Client()));
----

What this will do is create a mock `OAuth2AuthorizedClient`, passing it correctly through any authentication APIs.
It contains a mock `ClientRegistration` and associated access token.
It will register this `ClientRegistration` and access token in an `HttpSessionOAuth2AuthorizedClientRepository`.

By default, the access token contains only the `scope` attribute:

[source,json]
----
{
  "scope" : "read"
}
----

And the resulting `OAuth2AuthorizedClient`, were it tested, would pass in the following way:

[source,java]
----
assertThat(client.getClientRegistration().getRegistrationId()).isEqualTo("test");
assertThat(client.getAccessToken().getTokenValue()).isEqualTo("access-token");
assertThat(client.getPrincipalName()).isEqualTo("user");
----

These values can, of course, be configured.

Any client details can be configured via the `ClientRegistration.Builder` like so:

[source,java]
----
mvc.perform(get("/endpoint")
        .with(oauth2Client()
                .clientRegistration(client -> client.clientId("client-id"));
----

To supply the corresponding token, invoke `accessToken()` like this:

[source,java]
----
mvc.perform(get("/endpoint")
        .with(oauth2Client()
                .accessToken(new OAuth2AccessToken(BEARER, "my-value", issuedAt, expiresAt, scopes))));
----

===== `ClientRegistrationRepository` and `OAuth2AuthorizedClientRepository`

Under many circumstances, you will need to supply a registration id so that it can be looked up by exchange filter functions or `@RegisteredOAuth2AuthorizedClient` annotations.
For this reason, `oauth2Client()` ships with a convenience method:

[source,java]
----
mvc.perform(get("/endpoint").with(oauth2Client("facebook"));
----

This, however, doesn't know about your application's `ClientRegistrationRepository`, so calling this does not look up your "facebook" client registration for you.

To configure a test with an actual `ClientRegistration` from your `ClientRegistrationRepository` you can do:

[source,java]
----
@Autowired
ClientRegistrationRepository clientRegistrationRepository;

// ...

mvc.perform(get("/endpoint")
        .with(oauth2Client()
                .clientRegistration(this.clientRegistrationRepository.findByRegistrationId("facebook"))));
----

Also, `oauth2Client()` doesn't know about your application's `OAuth2AuthorizedClientRepository`, which is what Spring Security uses to resolve `@RegisteredOAuth2AuthorizedClient` annotations.
To make it available in your controllers, your app will need to be using an `HttpSessionOAuth2AuthorizedClientRepository` so that the token can be retrieved in a thread-safe way.

You can isolate this configuration to your test via a test configuration like the following:

[source,java]
----
@TestConfiguration
static class TestAuthorizedClientRepositoryConfig {
    @Bean
    OAuth2AuthorizedClientRepository authorizedClientRepository() {
        return new HttpSessionOAuth2AuthorizedClientRepository();
    }
}
----

[[testing-jwt]]
==== Testing JWT Authentication

In order to make an authorized request on a resource server, you need a bearer token.

If your resource server is configured for JWTs, then this would mean that the bearer token needs to be signed and then encoded according to the JWT specification.
All of this can be quite daunting, especially when this isn't the focus of your test.

Fortunately, there are a number of simple ways that you can overcome this difficulty and allow your tests to focus on authorization and not on representing bearer tokens.
We'll look at two of them now:

===== `jwt() RequestPostProcessor`

The first way is via a `RequestPostProcessor`.
The simplest of these would look something like this:

[source,java]
----
mvc
    .perform(get("/endpoint").with(jwt()));
----

What this will do is create a mock `Jwt`, passing it correctly through any authentication APIs so that it's available for your authorization mechanisms to verify.

By default, the `JWT` that it creates has the following characteristics:

[source,json]
----
{
  "headers" : { "alg" : "none" },
  "claims" : {
    "sub" : "user",
    "scope" : "read"
  }
}
----

And the resulting `Jwt`, were it tested, would pass in the following way:

[source,java]
----
assertThat(jwt.getTokenValue()).isEqualTo("token");
assertThat(jwt.getHeaders().get("alg")).isEqualTo("none");
assertThat(jwt.getSubject()).isEqualTo("sub");
GrantedAuthority authority = jwt.getAuthorities().iterator().next();
assertThat(authority.getAuthority()).isEqualTo("read");
----

These values can, of course be configured.

Any headers or claims can be configured with their corresponding methods:

[source,java]
----
mvc
    .perform(get("/endpoint")
        .with(jwt().jwt(jwt -> jwt.header("kid", "one").claim("iss", "https://idp.example.org"))));
----

[source,java]
----
mvc
    .perform(get("/endpoint")
        .with(jwt().jwt(jwt -> jwt.claims(claims -> claims.remove("scope")))));
----

The `scope` and `scp` claims are processed the same way here as they are in a normal bearer token request.
However, this can be overridden simply by providing the list of `GrantedAuthority` instances that you need for your test:

[source,java]
----
mvc
    .perform(get("/endpoint")
        .with(jwt().authorities(new SimpleGrantedAuthority("SCOPE_messages"))));
----

Or, if you have a custom `Jwt` to `Collection<GrantedAuthority>` converter, you can also use that to derive the authorities:

[source,java]
----
mvc
    .perform(get("/endpoint")
        .with(jwt().authorities(new MyConverter())));
----

You can also specify a complete `Jwt`, for which `{security-api-url}org/springframework/security/oauth2/jwt/Jwt.Builder.html[Jwt.Builder]` comes quite handy:

[source,java]
----
Jwt jwt = Jwt.withTokenValue("token")
    .header("alg", "none")
    .claim("sub", "user")
    .claim("scope", "read");

mvc
    .perform(get("/endpoint")
        .with(jwt().jwt(jwt)));
----

===== `authentication()` `RequestPostProcessor`

The second way is by using the `authentication()` `RequestPostProcessor`.
Essentially, you can instantiate your own `JwtAuthenticationToken` and provide it in your test, like so:

[source,java]
----
Jwt jwt = Jwt.withTokenValue("token")
    .header("alg", "none")
    .claim("sub", "user")
    .build();
Collection<GrantedAuthority> authorities = AuthorityUtils.createAuthorityList("SCOPE_read");
JwtAuthenticationToken token = new JwtAuthenticationToken(jwt, authorities);

mvc
    .perform(get("/endpoint")
        .with(authentication(token)));
----

Note that as an alternative to these, you can also mock the `JwtDecoder` bean itself with a `@MockBean` annotation.

[[testing-opaque-token]]
==== Testing Opaque Token Authentication

Or, if your resource server is configured for opaque tokens, then this would mean that the bearer token needs to be registered with and verified against an authorization server.
This can be just as distracting as creating a signed JWT.

There are two simple ways that you can overcome this difficulty and allow your tests to focus on authorization and not on representing bearer tokens.
Let's take a look:

===== `opaqueToken()` `RequestPostProcessor`

The first way is via a `RequestPostProcessor`.
The simplest of these would look something like this:

[source,java]
----
mvc.perform(get("/endpoint").with(opaqueToken()));
----

What this will do is create a mock `OAuth2AuthenticatedPrincipal`, passing it correctly through any authentication APIs so that it's available for your authorization mechanisms to verify.

By default, the set of attributes that it creates is like this:

[source,json]
----
{
  "sub" : "user",
  "scope" : "read"
}
----

And the resulting `OAuth2AuthenticatedPrincipal`, were it tested, would pass in the following way:

[source,java]
----
assertThat(principal.getAttribute("sub")).isEqualTo("user");
GrantedAuthority authority = principal.getAuthorities().iterator().next();
assertThat(authority.getAuthority()).isEqualTo("SCOPE_read");
----

These values can, of course be configured.

Any attributes can be configured via an underlying `Map`:

[source,java]
----
mvc.perform(get("/endpoint")
        .with(opaqueToken().attributes(attrs -> attrs
                .put("sub", "my-subject")
                .put("my-claim", "my-value"))));
----

[source,java]
----
mvc.perform(get("/endpoint")
        .with(opaqueToken().attributes(attrs -> attrs
                .remove("scope"))));
----

The `scope` attribute is processed the same way here as it is in a normal bearer token request.
However, this can be overridden simply by providing the list of `GrantedAuthority` instances that you need for your test:

[source,java]
----
mvc.perform(get("/endpoint")
        .with(opaqueToken().authorities(new SimpleGrantedAuthority("SCOPE_messages"))));
----

Or, you can supply all detail via an instance of `OAuth2AuthenticatedPrincipal` like so:

[source,java]
----
mvc.perform(get("/endpoint")
        .with(opaqueToken().principal(new MyAuthenticatedPrincipal())));
----

===== `authentication()` `RequestPostProcessor`

The second way is by using the `authentication()` `RequestPostProcessor`.
Essentially, you can instantiate your own `BearerTokenAuthentication` and provide it in your test, like so:

[source,java]
----
Map<String, Object> attributes = Collections.singletonMap("sub", "user");
OAuth2AccessToken accessToken = new OAuth2AccessToken(BEARER, "token", null, null);
Collection<GrantedAuthority> authorities = AuthorityUtils.createAuthorityList("SCOPE_read");
OAuth2AuthenticatedPrincipal principal = new DefaultOAuth2AuthenticatedPrincipal(attributes, authorities);

BearerTokenAuthentication token = new BearerTokenAuthentication(attributes, accessToken, authorities);

mvc.perform(get("/endpoint")
        .with(authentication(token)));
----

Note that as an alternative to these, you can also mock the `OpaqueTokenIntrospector` bean itself with a `@MockBean` annotation.

[[test-logout]]
==== Testing Logout

While fairly trivial using standard Spring MVC Test, you can use Spring Security's testing support to make testing log out easier.
For example, the following will submit a POST to "/logout" with a valid CSRF token:

[source,java]
----
mvc
	.perform(logout())
----

You can also customize the URL to post to.
For example, the snippet below will submit a POST to "/signout" with a valid CSRF token:

[source,java]
----
mvc
	.perform(logout("/signout"))
----

=== SecurityMockMvcResultMatchers

At times it is desirable to make various security related assertions about a request.
To accommodate this need, Spring Security Test support implements Spring MVC Test's `ResultMatcher` interface.
In order to use Spring Security's `ResultMatcher` implementations ensure the following static import is used:

[source,java]
----
import static org.springframework.security.test.web.servlet.response.SecurityMockMvcResultMatchers.*;
----

==== Unauthenticated Assertion

At times it may be valuable to assert that there is no authenticated user associated with the result of a `MockMvc` invocation.
For example, you might want to test submitting an invalid username and password and verify that no user is authenticated.
You can easily do this with Spring Security's testing support using something like the following:

[source,java]
----
mvc
	.perform(formLogin().password("invalid"))
	.andExpect(unauthenticated());
----

==== Authenticated Assertion

It is often times that we must assert that an authenticated user exists.
For example, we may want to verify that we authenticated successfully.
We could verify that a form based login was successful with the following snippet of code:

[source,java]
----
mvc
	.perform(formLogin())
	.andExpect(authenticated());
----

If we wanted to assert the roles of the user, we could refine our previous code as shown below:

[source,java]
----
mvc
	.perform(formLogin().user("admin"))
	.andExpect(authenticated().withRoles("USER","ADMIN"));
----

Alternatively, we could verify the username:

[source,java]
----
mvc
	.perform(formLogin().user("admin"))
	.andExpect(authenticated().withUsername("admin"));
----

We can also combine the assertions:

[source,java]
----
mvc
	.perform(formLogin().user("admin").roles("USER","ADMIN"))
	.andExpect(authenticated().withUsername("admin"));
----

We can also make arbitrary assertions on the authentication

[source,java]
----
mvc
	.perform(formLogin())
	.andExpect(authenticated().withAuthentication(auth ->
		assertThat(auth).isInstanceOf(UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken.class)));
----
